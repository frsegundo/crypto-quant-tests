## Testing trading ideas in crypto markets

As I try to apply to crypto markets some techniques already widely used in tradional markets, I will share the few success and many mistakes here through python scripts.

### /studies

Maybe a tough as to execute, there is the phase to think and research trading ideas. In this folder there will be some scripts used in these steps. 

[/studies/studiesLib.py](https://github.com/frsegundo/crypto-quant-tests/blob/main/studies/studiesLib.py) I am never sure if this is a good practice or not, but i like to concentrated too operational functions in a separated module. Why?
  1 - So i can use the same function in another script
  2 - To keep the main script clean, which makes future analyses really easier.
